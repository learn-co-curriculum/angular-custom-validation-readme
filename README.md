# Custom validation with $validators

## Overview

The built-in validation in HTML forms can only go so far. However, we can actually define custom validation rules!

## Objectives

- Describe the $validators pipeline
- Write a custom validator
- Integrate the custom validator with ngMessages

## $validators

Sometimes HTML validators arent enough - for instance, we can't test if data fits to a certain format (like requiring that a string must be 2 characters, 2 numbers and then 2 characters again), or if an input is only numbers.

Let's create a directive to see if our input is *only* numbers. Up until now we've only used directives as elements with templates. However, we're now creating directives as attributes (remember that we can restrict our directives to only be attributes) and not having a template - by applying our directive to an element, we're affecting the behaviour of that element - not the contents.

Much like `$parsers` and `$formatters`, we add our custom validators into `$validators`. Here we have a function where we can test if the value is valid, returning true or false depending on their validity.

```js
function integer() {
	return {
		restrict: 'A',
		require: 'ngModel',
		link: function (scope, element, attrs, ngModel) {
			ngModel.$validators.integer = function (value) {
				return value.test(/^\-?\d+$/);
			};
		}
	}
}

angular
	.module('app')
	.directive('integer', integer);
```

You might've noticed we're simply adding to the `ngModel.$validators` object instead of pushing into it. This is because we need to give our validators a simple name that will then get added to our `$errors` object if the validation returns false. We can also use these custom validators in `ngMessages`! To activate this validation on an input, we add it as an attribute like when we use `maxlength`, etc.

Example usage of our new validator would look like this:

```html
<form name="form">
	<input name="number" ng-model="ctrl.number" integer />

	<div ng-messages="form.number.$errors">
		<div ng-message="integer">Number must be an integer!</div>
	</div>
</form>
```

Awesome! Custom validation that slots in nicely with the built-in validation we've used previously.
